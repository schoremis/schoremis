## Projects

### [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_5_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

#### Summary
The stakeholder of this project is a **Group of Hospitals** located in Florida, US that want to study the **main risk factors for stroke** and examine **if the risk of stroke can be predicted.**
Our stakeholder is planning to use our analysis to **educate high risk patients about the warning signs** of a stroke and inform them about the **actions that they need to take in case that they detect an event**. 
Early detection and treatment of a stroke is extremely important as it can **minimize brain damage.**

This project will analyze **historic data of patients** in order to examine if there is any **correlation** but also study **if a stroke event can be predicted based on specific variables**.

To achieve this, the project is using **Machine Learning Classification** principles and algorithms
    
    
According to our analysis, the most important variables that **drive a stroke event** are the below:

- **Age**: The risk for a stroke event is increasing by age. 
  -  Stroke events very rarely occur to patients below 40 years old. 
  -  The risk for patients that are over 65 years old to experiance a stroke event is from 5% to 24%
- **High Blood presure:**: : Patients with high blood presure are more likely to experiance a stroke compared to patients without high blood presure
- **Heart Disease History**: Patients with Heart Disease History are more likely to experiance a stroke event compared to patients without a Heart Disease History

According to the above conclusions, we offer the below **recommendations**:
* `1:` Hospitals should gather **additional Data that can help us improve our model**. 
  - Our models used a small amount of variables. Hospitals should gather and provide additional information about the medical history of the patients that can improve the accurecy and recall rates of our models. Some examples are if the patient exercises regularly, the cholestoral levels, the maximum heart rate achieved, or the resting blood pressure of the patient.
  - The specific classification was undertaken on a small sample size of less than 5,000 patients. Therefore, our model can be further improve by increasing the amount of patients.
* `2:` Our approach and models can be used to **detect other illnesses that cause death or long-term disability**. Analyzing and predicting the Heart Attack risk is an example.
* `3:` Doctors can use our models to **inform patients about the risk level for a stroke event**. This will help patients to be better educated about the Warning Signs and the actions that they need to take in case of an event

### [Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_4_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

#### Summary
The project is analyzing **historic chest x-ray images** of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou in order to **predict whether a future patient has Pneumonia**. 

- Our Project analyzed **5,863 X-Ray images** provided by Kaggle, organized into 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
- **6 Machine Learning Models** were built in our project that generated an accuracy rate from 75% to 85% and recall rated from 98% to 99.42%
- **99.42% Recall rate** was achieved at the 3rd model, CNN with higher epochs

### [Customer Churn](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_3_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

#### Summary
The project is analyzing **historic data** of Syriatel **one of the only two mobile network providers in Syria** in order to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel. 

In addition, the project will study the **predictable patterns** and **provide recommendations** to SyriaTel management for customer churn reduction.    

    
According to our analysis, the **most important factors** that drive the decision of a Syriatel Mobile customer to churn are the below:

- **International Plan**: 42% of the customers that have international plan churned
- **Total charges**: : Customers with high charges are more likely to churn
- **Customer Service Calls**: Customers that call the customer service line frequently (especially 4 times and more), have higher probabilities to churn

According to the above conclusions, we offer the below **recommendations**:
- 1: Syriatel should introduce a **new program for customers with high usage**. This new program can include **unlimeted calls for a monthly fee, similar to the competition.**
- 2: Syriatel should introducce a **new international plan that is more competitive**. Should analyse the prices that the competition offer for International plans and provide a similar plan
- 3: Syriatel should pay attention to the number of customer service calls that each customer makes. **Customers that call frequently the customer service line should be offered promotions or other programs to keep them with Syriatel**


### [King County Housing Price Predictions](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_2_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

#### Summary
The project is analyzing **historic data** of real estate transactions in **King County Washington** in provide answers to the following questions:
    
 - What are the key variables that drive Real Estate Prices in King County Washington. 
    
 - When is the best time to sell real estate in King County Washington
    
 - By what amount a property renovation is increasing the value of a property in King County Washington

Our Analysis **conclude to the following**:
   
 - Location, Grade and Sq Ft of Living space are the main drivers of real estate price
    
 - The highest real estate demand is during Spring and Summer
    
 - If a property owner can increase the grade by one point for less than $11 per square foot, he should consider renovating


### [Movie Analysis for Microsoft](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_1_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

#### Summary
Microsoft has decided to create its own studio to make original movies and business stakeholders need to decide what genre of movie Microsoft should produce.
This project will analyze **historic data of the movie industry** in order to help Microsoft make a **well informed decision**

This report is analyzing data from the Movie Industry to determine which Movie Genre Microsoft should select for creating it's first original video content.
Our Analysis recommends that Microsoft should create an **Animation movie**.
According to historic data, Animated Movies have in general **high Ratings**, **high Revenue** and the **highest profitability** compared to 15 other Genres.
