## Projects

### [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_5_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Developed machine learning models to predict the likelihood of stroke using electronic health records.
* **Methods:** Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify key factors such as age, heart disease, glucose levels, and hypertension.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized data, engineered features, and handled missing values.
* **Results:** Achieved an AUC of 89% and overall accuracy of 85% on a dataset of 10,000 patient records.
* **Impact:** Provided actionable insights to healthcare providers to prioritize high-risk patients, enhancing early intervention strategies.

### [Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_4_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Though completely treatable, pneumonia continues to be the world's leading cause of death of children under the age of five.
Once pneumonia has started, time is of the importance since, in severe circumstances, a patient could pass away in a matter of hours.
However, radiologists are overworked which delays diagnoses and increases their margin for error. AI assisted diagnoses are the solution to this problem.
In an effort to ensure that no child should die from a treatable illness, I developed a convolutional neural network with 99% recall. 

### [Customer Churn](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_3_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
One of the most crucial indicators a business can monitor is churn, which offers critical information about customer satisfaction and the organization as a whole.
SyriaTel's churn is 14 times higher than that of their top 5 telecom sector rivals.
In my examination of clients who had left the company, I came to the conclusion that "calls to customer support" and "day call charges" were significant predictors of a client's propensity to "soon churn."
I developed a machine learning model with 87% recall that can predict whether a client will "soon churn" using these features and several others. 

### [Housing Price Predictions](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_2_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Zillow has been criticized for its less-than-accurate Zestimate forecasts.
In this project, I developed regression models that estimate the real estate prices in King County Washington by analyzing historic data of property transactions. The project determines the key variables that drive property prices, the best time to sell real estate, and the amount by which a property renovation increases the selling price.

### [Movie Analysis for Microsoft](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_1_Project-S.Choremis), 2022

In this hypothetical scenario, Microsoft has made the decision create original movies to compete with Netflix, Amazon and Apple streaming services. 
The project is using data science principles and historic data of the movie industry to determine what type of film Microsoft should produce.
According to historic data, the project concludes that Animated Movies have in general high Ratings, high Revenue and the highest profitability compared to 15 other Genres.
