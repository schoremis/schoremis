## Projects

### [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_5_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Developed machine learning models to predict the likelihood of stroke using electronic health records.
* **Methods:** Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify key factors such as age, heart disease, glucose levels, and hypertension.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized data, engineered features, and handled missing values.
* **Results:** Achieved an AUC of 89% and overall accuracy of 85% on a dataset of 10,000 patient records.
* **Impact:** Provided actionable insights to healthcare providers to prioritize high-risk patients, enhancing early intervention strategies.

### [Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_4_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Built an AI model to assist radiologists in detecting pneumonia using chest X-rays.
* **Model:** Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers and a fully connected architecture using TensorFlow.
* **Data:** Processed 6,000 pediatric X-rays from a publicly available dataset.
* **Results:** Achieved 92% accuracy and a recall rate of 99.42%, ensuring reliable detection of pneumonia in high-risk cases.
* **Impact:** Accelerated diagnostic accuracy in under-resourced medical facilities, contributing to better patient outcomes.

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_3_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Created a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for telecom providers.
* **Approach:** Analyzed 5,000 customer records with feature engineering techniques like encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical data.
* **Models:** Employed Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers for prediction.
* **Results:** Achieved 87% recall and 82% precision, identifying key churn indicators such as "calls to customer support" and "day call charges."
* **Impact:** Provided insights to reduce churn rates, saving up to $200,000 annually in retention costs in simulated scenarios.

### [Housing Price Predictions](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_2_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Developed predictive models to estimate real estate prices in King County, Washington.
* **Techniques:** Utilized Linear Regression and XGBoost for regression analysis, identifying key drivers such as square footage, location, and renovation quality.
* **Data:** Analyzed 20,000 property transactions from public datasets.
* **Results:** Achieved an RMSE of $15,000, providing reliable predictions of property values.
* **Insights:** Identified that proximity to public transport increased property prices by an average of 15%.

### [Movie Analysis for Microsoft](https://github.com/schoremis/Phase_1_Project-S.Choremis), 2022
Designed a data-driven strategy to identify profitable movie genres for Microsoftâ€™s potential streaming service.
* **Data:** Analyzed historic movie performance data from IMDb and BoxOffice Mojo, focusing on 1,500 films.
* **Techniques:** Applied clustering and regression to determine trends in ratings, revenue, and profitability.
* **Findings:** Animated films had a 40% higher ROI compared to other genres and consistently received high audience ratings.
* **Impact:** Provided insights into content acquisition and production strategies for maximum profitability.
